    <h4>Hybrid</h4>
    <img src="images/hybrid.png" alt="MobileApps" style=width="200" height="200">
      <p>Hybrid mobile apps are built with a combination of web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The key difference is that hybrid apps are hosted inside a native application that utilizes a mobile platform’s WebView. (You can think of the WebView as a chromeless browser window that’s typically configured to run fullscreen.) 
        This enables them to access device capabilities such as the accelerometer, camera, contacts, and more. These are capabilities that are often restricted to access from inside mobile browsers. Furthermore, hybrid mobile apps can include native UI elements.</p>

    <h4>Native</h4>
    <img src="images/native.jpg" alt="MobileApps" style=width="200" height="200">
      <p>The term native app is used to refer to platforms such as Mac and PC, with examples such as the Photos, Mail or Contacts applications that are preinstalled and configured on every Apple computer. in the context of mobile web apps, the term native app is used to mean any application written to work on a specific device platform. The two main mobile OS platforms are Apple's iOS and Google's Android. Native apps are written in the code preliminarily used for the device and its OS. For example, developers write iOS applications in Objective-C, Swift, App creat in Java.</p>

      <p>
MEAN is a set of Open Source components that together, provide an end-to-end framework for building dynamic web applications; The stack is made up of: Angular: Front-end web app framework; runs your JavaScript code in the user's browser, allowing your application UI to be dynamic.
Express: Back-end web application framework running on top of Node.js.
Node.js: JavaScript runtime environment that lets you implement your application back-end in JavaScript.
MongoDB: Document database used by your back-end application to store its data as JSON documents.</p>

      <p>MongoDB is an open source database uses a document-oriented data model. MongoDB is several database types to arise in the mid-2000s under the NoSQL banner. Instead of using tables & rows as in relational databases, MongoDB is built on an architecture of collections and documents. Documents comprise sets of key-value pairs & unit of data.</p>

      <p>An Oracle database is a collection of data treated as a unit. The purpose of a database is to store and retrieve related information. A database server is the key to solving the problems of information management. In general, a server reliably manages a large amount of data in a multiuser environment so that many users can concurrently access the same data.</p>

      <p>Java is a programming language and computing platform first released by Sun Microsystems in 1995. There are lots of applications and websites that will not work unless you have Java installed, and more are created every day. Java is fast, secure, and reliable. From laptops to datacenters, game consoles to scientific supercomputers, cell phones to the Internet, Java is everywhere!</p>
